C# Projects

These are some small projects I made using C# and the .Net Framework

Projects:
Car Insurance
CodeFirst

Car Insurance

This project is asn MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes the user's input
on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. there is also an admin page that
allows  staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued.

CodeFirst

This is an example of a code first workflow that utilizes Entity Framework 6 to establish a database for a
student application. This is still a work in progress.
